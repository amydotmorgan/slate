## Transactions


To calculate tax but not include that calculate on a future filing (e.g. to present tax on a quote or pre-sale order), use the `Calculations` resource. When you want to record that sale for filing and reporting, you should call the `Transactions` resource.

The request and response formats for both resources is the same, and the response simply adds tax calculation and resolution information to the request format. All formats are documented in the TaxDocument Format section.
