# AvaTax REST API

> **Note:** You will not be able to make web service calls until you have received an active account number and license key via email, or a username and password from the <a href='http://developer.avalara.com/getting-started' target="_parent">sandbox registration</a>.

The Avalara AvaTax APIs allow you to connect your web cart or accounting software to realtime tax calculation and address validation services. You can just retrieve tax amounts, but your transactions can also be recorded for reporting and tax filing. We have a RESTful API, class wrappers (adapters) for PHP, Java, and .NET compiled from the SOAP API, or you can build your own wrappers directly from the <a href='https://development.avalara.net/address/addresssvc.wsdl' target="_blank">address</a> and <a href='https://development.avalara.net/tax/taxsvc.wsdl' target="_blank">tax service</a> SOAP WSDLs.

The AvaTax REST API exposes the most commonly used available for interacting with the AvaTax service, allowing calculation of tax, modification of documents, and validation of addresses. If you're unsure of which API to use, a full comparison of the differences between the functionality provided by our REST and SOAP interfaces is documented <a href='http://developer.avalara.com/api-docs/designing-your-integration/soap-or-rest' target="_parent">here</a>.

The sample code on this page is intended to give you an idea of how the methods are used, but you can find functioning sample source projects with full class libraries from our <a href='http://github.com/avadev' target="_parent">API Sample Code page</a>.
