# REST API

The Avalara REST API exposes the most commonly used available for interacting with the AvaTax service, allowing calculation of tax, modification of documents, and validation of addresses - including some functionality not exposed by our REST API.
If you're unsure of which API to use, a full comparison of the differences between the functionality provided by our REST and SOAP interfaces is documented [here](http://developer.avalara.com/api-docs/designing-your-integration/soap-or-rest).
